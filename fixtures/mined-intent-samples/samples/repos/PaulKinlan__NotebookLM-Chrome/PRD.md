#### 4.7 Transform Persistence & Management

Each generated transform result can be saved, deleted, or opened in a new tab for full-screen viewing. **Transform history is per-notebook** - when switching between folios, the Transform tab shows only the saved transforms for that specific folio.

**Features:**
- **Save Transform**: Click the save icon to persist a generated transform to IndexedDB storage. Saved transforms are associated with the notebook and can be accessed later.
- **Delete Transform**: Click the delete/close icon to remove a transform from the list. If the transform was saved, it is also deleted from storage.
- **Open in New Tab**: Click the external link icon to open the transform content in a new browser tab, enabling full-screen viewing. This is especially useful for interactive content like slides, quizzes, and mind maps that benefit from more screen space.
- **Per-Notebook Transform History**: Switching notebooks clears the Transform tab and loads saved transforms for the newly selected notebook. Unsaved transforms are cleared when switching.

**UI Changes:**
- Transform result card header now includes four action buttons (left to right):
  - Save (floppy disk icon) - Persists to storage, icon fills when saved
  - Open in new tab (external link icon) - Opens full-screen view
  - Copy (clipboard icon) - Copies content to clipboard
  - Remove/Delete (X or trash icon) - Removes card and deletes from storage if saved
- Saved transforms show a green border indicator
- Save button changes to filled icon and "Saved" tooltip after saving
- Close button changes to trash icon and "Delete" tooltip after saving

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Save button persists transform content to IndexedDB storage
- [x] Saved transforms show visual indicator (green border, filled save icon)
- [x] Delete button removes from both UI and storage
- [x] Open in new tab creates blob URL and opens in new Chrome tab
- [x] Interactive content (quizzes, slides, etc.) renders correctly in new tab
- [x] Markdown content is rendered with proper styling in new tab
- [x] Blob URLs are cleaned up after tab opens to prevent memory leaks
- [x] Transform history is per-notebook (switching notebooks loads saved transforms for that notebook)

#### 4.8 Concurrent Transforms & Background Execution

Users can start multiple transformations simultaneously without waiting for previous ones to complete. Each transform runs independently in the background service worker and displays its progress in the transform history.

**Background Execution:**
Transformations run in the background service worker, allowing them to continue even when the side panel is closed:
- **Persistent State**: Pending transforms are saved to IndexedDB, surviving side panel close/reopen
- **Automatic Resume**: When the side panel reopens, it syncs with any transforms that completed while closed
- **Service Worker Restart**: On service worker restart, any interrupted transforms are automatically resumed
- **Message Passing**: Side panel communicates with background via chrome.runtime messages (START_TRANSFORM, TRANSFORM_PROGRESS, TRANSFORM_COMPLETE, etc.)

**Features:**
- **Queue Multiple Transforms**: Users can click on multiple transform type buttons without waiting for previous transforms to finish
- **Pending Transform Display**: Each in-progress transform shows in the transform history with a spinning indicator and "Generating..." message
- **Independent Completion**: Each transform completes independently and is added to history when done
- **Error Isolation**: If one transform fails, others continue running unaffected
- **Survivable Execution**: Transforms continue running even if the side panel is closed

**UI Changes:**
- Section title shows count of generating transforms when any are pending (e.g., "Transforms (2 generating...)")
- Pending transform cards appear at the top of the history list with:
  - Dashed purple border to distinguish from completed transforms
  - Spinning progress indicator in the header
  - "Generating [type]..." message in the content area
  - Start time displayed in the metadata

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Multiple transforms can be initiated while others are in progress
- [x] Each pending transform displays with loading indicator
- [x] Completed transforms are added to history in completion order
- [x] Failed transforms are removed from pending without affecting others
- [x] `pendingTransforms` signal tracks all in-progress transforms
- [x] `pending` property exposed from useTransform hook
- [x] Transforms continue running when side panel is closed
- [x] Pending transforms persist to IndexedDB
- [x] Side panel syncs with background state on open

## Success Metrics

- Sources added per notebook (target: avg 5+)
- Queries per session (target: avg 3+)
- Transformation usage rate
- User retention (weekly active users)
- Chrome Web Store rating
- **Multimodal source adoption** (% of notebooks with non-text sources)
- **PDF sources per user** (target: avg 2+ for research users)

## Architecture Decisions

### Storage: IndexedDB
All data stored in IndexedDB with `unlimitedStorage` permission for unlimited local storage capacity:
- `unlimitedStorage` permission removes Chrome's default 5MB storage limit
- Notebooks and sources stored separately (sources reference notebookId)
- Settings stored as key-value pairs
- Designed for future sync with SyncableEntity base type
- Media references stored as URLs (not blobs) to minimize storage

### Offline Support
- Chrome Built-in AI works fully offline (Gemini Nano)
- Sources and notebooks available offline (stored in IndexedDB)
- **Response caching**: AI responses are cached with their query and source IDs
- **Offline fallback**: When offline or API errors occur, cached responses are used
- **Cache key**: Deterministic hash of query + sorted source IDs ensures consistent cache hits
- Cloud AI providers require network for new queries

### Sync Strategy
Design with sync hooks for future server-based sync:
- Each entity has `syncStatus`, `remoteId`, `lastSynced`
- StorageAdapter interface abstracts storage operations
- Server sync implementation deferred to future phase

### Chrome Built-in AI
Uses `@built-in-ai/core` community package for Vercel AI SDK compatibility:
- No API key required
- Works offline
- Requires Chrome 128+ with experimental flags

### Multimodal AI Strategy
- Text sources: All providers support text context
- Image sources: Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4V+ support images
- Video/Audio: Store references, use multimodal providers for analysis
- Graceful degradation: Text-only providers receive text description of media

## Appendix: Chrome Built-in AI

Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano) is available in Chrome 128+ with experimental flags.

**Package:** `@built-in-ai/core`

**Usage:**
<!-- stripped fenced code block: typescript -->

**Benefits:**
- Free (no API costs)
- Fast (runs locally)
- Private (data doesn't leave device)
- Works offline

**Limitations:**
- Smaller model (less capable than cloud models)
- Limited context window
- Requires Chrome flags to enable (for now)
- Not available on all devices
- Text-only (no multimodal support)

**Model Download:**
- The Gemini Nano model (~1.5GB) is downloaded on-demand when first used
- Chrome requires a user gesture (click, keypress) to initiate the download
- FolioLM automatically triggers the download during onboarding when the user interacts with the UI
- Download progress is logged to the console; the download continues in the background
- If the model is already downloaded, no additional action is taken
